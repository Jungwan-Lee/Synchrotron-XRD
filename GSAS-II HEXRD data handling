GSAS-II
(1) With calibrated imctrl file
Import the image (tif) data, the first one
Parm - Import calibrated imctrl data (Load Controls)
  If calibration not done, refer to cali file
To obtain PWDR, go to integration tap for Image Controls, do integrate 
Import - integrate tif data - image (IMG) and powder (PWDR) files generated, time takes depending on number of files
Once done, on the 1D profile, press m, then merged graphs appear
For stacked 1D profile (merged), Data - Sum or Average powder data
For stacked 1D profile (stacked over time), Export - powder data - stacked csv file

(2) With 
Open new project, save the name
Load phase cif files
Load first image tif file
Image Controls - Parms - load Si cali imctrl file
Image Controls - check "Show integration limits", "Do full integration", "Use for all new images"
Image Controls - Integration - Integrate, then PWDR generated
PWDR, check Limits
  Peak List, manually click the peaks in 1D graph (e.g., ferrite peaks - 6 major peaks in 03-15 deg)


**GSAS others
Delete data: Data - Delete data entries - click the target

In Origin, choose 3D profile or 3D color surface,
  For profiling, 3D waterfall
  For zooming in, Scale Zoom-panning tool, Z+mouse-wheeling can make you zoom in
  For restoring 3D graph, ctrl+R
Time stamp can be confirmed at Filezilla; the data numbering and time stamp are synchronized

Lattice parameter export in GSAS-II
add phase cif's
check Refine unit cell in general
check histogram linked (all data linked to cif phase)
Calculate - Refine, it takes time
