GSAS-II
(0) Cali
Max intensity 0-90000 (set by yourself)
Image Controls, put Wavelength and Distance (uncheck wavelength; it is fixed), put Calibrant (Si if used), put inner/outer 2theta (3.0-15.5)
Image Controls - Calibrate
Point 5 points (right click background anywhere, left click 5 points on innermost ring, then right click - it shows rings)

(1) With calibrated imctrl file
Import the image (tif) data, the first one
Parm - Import calibrated imctrl data (Load Controls)
  If calibration not done, refer to cali file
To obtain PWDR, go to integration tap for Image Controls, do integrate 
Import - integrate tif data - image (IMG) and powder (PWDR) files generated, time takes depending on number of files
Once done, on the 1D profile, press m, then merged graphs appear
For stacked 1D profile (merged), Data - Sum or Average powder data
For stacked 1D profile (stacked over time), Export - powder data - stacked csv file

(2) With 
Open new project, save the name
Load phase cif files
Load first image tif file
Image Controls - Parms - load Si cali imctrl file
Image Controls - check "Show integration limits", "Do full integration", "Use for all new images"
Image Controls - Integration - Integrate, then PWDR generated
PWDR, check Limits
  Peak List, manually click the peaks in 1D graph (e.g., ferrite peaks - 6 major peaks in 03-15 deg)
  i) Check intensity refines are checked, Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  ii) Add positions, Peak Fitting - Peakfit (double-click refine, Y-vary all)
  iii) Instrument Parameters - check U, V, W, X, Y, Peak List - Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  iv) Refine both sigma2 and gamma, Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  Index Peak List - Operations - Load/Reload
  Unit Cells List - check Cubic-I if ferrite peaks,

Delete data: Data - Delete data entries - click the target

In Origin, choose 3D profile or 3D color surface,
  For profiling, 3D waterfall
  For zooming in, Scale Zoom-panning tool, Z+mouse-wheeling can make you zoom in
  For restoring 3D graph, ctrl+R
Time stamp can be confirmed at Filezilla; the data numbering and time stamp are synchronized

Lattice parameter export in GSAS-II
add phase cif's
check Refine unit cell in general
check histogram linked (all data linked to cif phase)
Calculate - Refine, it takes time
