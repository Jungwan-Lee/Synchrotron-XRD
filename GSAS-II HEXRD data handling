GSAS-II: capillary (Debye-Scherrer)
(0) Cali
New project - Import - Si tif file (used calibrant), IMG dataset will be imported
Max intensity 0-90000 (set by yourself so that rings are identified)
Image Controls, put Wavelength (e.g., 0.207324 A) and Distance-SDD1100 (uncheck wavelength; it is fixed), put Calibrant (e.g., Si), put inner/outer 2theta (3.0-15.5)
  Other parameters don't need to touch
Image Controls - Calibrate
Point 5 points on innermost ring (left click); don't need to magnify; then right click - it shows rings in blue lines
Masks - press F on 2D Powder Image, left click 4 corners of a square; designate the region; the size doesn't matter, done - right click
Image Controls - Calibration - Recalibrate, retry several times so that parameters do not change
Parms - Save Controls - imctrl file
Image Controls - check "Show integration limits", "Do full integration", "Use for all new images"
Image Controls - Integration - Integrate, then PWDR generated

(00) 1D histogram fitting
At PWDR dataset,
Limits, Tmin to 3.5, Tmax to 13.5 (set by yourself); powder pattern has more data than I need
Background,
  function: chebyschev-1, check at "Refine?"
  Number of coeff.: 6
  Fixed Points - Add - click background (no peak points) on the Powder Patterns, more than 6 points with left click
  Fixed Points - Fit background, then red line generated, and 6 Background coeff. calculated automatically
Peak List, manually click the peaks in 1D graph (if not accurate the center peak, then click double peaks)
  i) Check intensity refines are checked (double-click refine, Y - vary all), Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  ii) Uncheck intensity, Check position, Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  iii) Uncheck position, check gamma (peak width), Instrument Parameters - check U, V, W, X, Y, Peak List - Peak Fitting - Peakfit
    Rwp ~5-6% is good, once red (minus value) appears, then redo only for the red one, while U/V/W/X/Y checked
      if it gets worse, then Peak Fitting - Undo and remove the peak; Peak Fitting - Delete peaks 
    Sometimes just clicking the red one changes the value to positive; then leave it unchecked
    Check the graph fitting of Instrument Parameters; the graph mush be concave downward
  iv) Uncheck U/V/W/X/Y, Refine both sigma2 and gamma, Peak Fitting - Peakfit
    Once red appears, then redo only for the red one
  Index Peak List - Operations - Load/Reload
  Unit Cells List - check Cubic-I for ferrite, Cubic-F for aus/Si
    Cell Index/Refine - Index Cell, Indexing Result will appear when fitting is good
    Cell Index/Refine - Copy cell
    Click "Ref?" at Zero offset (Zero offset should be 0), Cell Index/Refine - Refine cell
    Modulate lattice parameter by setting cell step 0.5%, looking at peaks
    Δ2θ value can be confirmed in Position calibration tab in the graph; 

(1) With calibrated imctrl file
Import the image (tif) data, the first one
Parm - Import calibrated imctrl data (Load Controls)
  If calibration not done, refer to cali file
To obtain PWDR, go to integration tap for Image Controls, do integrate 
Import - integrate tif data - image (IMG) and powder (PWDR) files generated, time takes depending on number of files
Once done, on the 1D profile, press m, then merged graphs appear
For stacked 1D profile (merged), Data - Sum or Average powder data
For stacked 1D profile (stacked over time), Export - powder data - stacked csv file

(2) With 
Open new project, save the name
Load phase cif files
Load first image tif file
Image Controls - Parms - load Si cali imctrl file
Image Controls - check "Show integration limits", "Do full integration", "Use for all new images"
Image Controls - Integration - Integrate, then PWDR generated
PWDR, check Limits
  Peak List, manually click the peaks in 1D graph (e.g., ferrite peaks - 6 major peaks in 03-15 deg)
  i) Check intensity refines are checked, Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  ii) Add positions, Peak Fitting - Peakfit (double-click refine, Y-vary all)
  iii) Instrument Parameters - check U, V, W, X, Y, Peak List - Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  iv) Refine both sigma2 and gamma, Peak Fitting - Peakfit
  Index Peak List - Operations - Load/Reload
  Unit Cells List - check Cubic-I if ferrite peaks,

Delete data: Data - Delete data entries - click the target

In Origin, choose 3D profile or 3D color surface,
  For profiling, 3D waterfall
  For zooming in, Scale Zoom-panning tool, Z+mouse-wheeling can make you zoom in
  For restoring 3D graph, ctrl+R
Time stamp can be confirmed at Filezilla; the data numbering and time stamp are synchronized

Lattice parameter export in GSAS-II
add phase cif's
check Refine unit cell in general
check histogram linked (all data linked to cif phase)
Calculate - Refine, it takes time
